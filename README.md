# 🔧 Neo4j and LangChain Flask App

Welcome to the **Neo4j and LangChain Flask App**! This repository provides a robust framework to retrieve structured and unstructured data using Neo4j, OpenAI, and LangChain. Below, you will find a detailed guide to help you understand and get started with the application.

---

## 📖 **Features**

- 🔒 **Secure Connections**: Seamlessly integrates with Neo4j and OpenAI using environment variables for authentication.
- 🌐 **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines structured queries with unstructured similarity search for comprehensive data retrieval.
- 💡 **AI-Powered Answers**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to provide concise and natural-language answers.
- 📊 **Customizable Workflows**: Fully modular chain using LangChain's runnable framework.
- 🚀 **Flask-based API**: Simple endpoints to interact with the system and retrieve insights.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up and run the app locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
Set Up the Environment: Create a .env file in the root directory and include the following variables:

env
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEO4J_URI=your_neo4j_uri
NEO4J_USERNAME=your_neo4j_username
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password
Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: Start the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

🌟 How It Works
Structured Data Retrieval: The app queries Neo4j using full-text search and relationship traversal to extract structured data.

Unstructured Data Retrieval: The Neo4j vector store (backed by OpenAI embeddings) is used to perform similarity searches for unstructured data.

Answer Generation: Combines structured and unstructured data to generate concise answers via OpenAI’s GPT model.
